Hey, Harsh Kumar Here! 
My SID is 21105022 
I am from ECE department and my CGPA is 9.900000
	program 3
a = 56
b = 10
binary representation of a= 0b111000
binary representation of b= 0b1010
a&b= 8
a|b= 58
a^b= 50
Left shift both a and b with 2 bits
 a<<2= 224 
 b<<2= 40
Right shift a with 2 bits and b with 4 bits
 a>>2= 14 
 b>>4= 0
